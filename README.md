# Arxiv-Visualizer
A FastAPI service that transforms arXiv PDFs into standardized Markdown with normalized images, then leverages OpenRouter LLMs with Structured Outputs to produce strict schema-compliant JSON for fine-grained front-end rendering of papers (TOC, equations, figures, tables, citations, and cross-references).
